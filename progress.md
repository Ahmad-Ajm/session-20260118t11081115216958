# Progress

## 2026-01-18

- Reviewed `conversation-summary.md` (approved; not modified).
- Verified `features-map.md` is already populated (not a template) and matches the current approved feature list (FEAT-001 … FEAT-013).
- Current overall feature status: **all features are Not-Start** (per orchestration rule: Not-Start → Planned → In-Progress).
- Dependencies/relations are already captured in `features-map.md` and remain unchanged (no new requirements to adjust).

### Open questions captured (no decisions yet)
- Who can view “all available CVs” (public visitors vs logged-in only)?
- What counts as “sensitive data” to mask in export (e.g., mobile)?
- Export format (PDF / printable page / file).
- Single CV per user vs multiple.
- Auth method (email/phone/password/OTP).
- Publish/visibility control for CV availability.
- Search fields and filter criteria.
- UI languages (Arabic only vs multilingual).
